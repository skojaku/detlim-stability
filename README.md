# Detectability limit and the stability of solution 


## Idea 

The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix is swamped by the bulk of eigenvalues as soon as the network gets sparser. Sooner than what the theoretical detectability limit predicts. But the bulk contains some information, i.e., the bulk distribution is different from that of the random graphs in the detectable regime. That is, the adjacnecy matrix still contains the information about the communities in the spectral regime. 

The key idea is to shift attention from the solutions themselves but the stability. We hypothise that the ground-truth solution lies in a smooth basin while the random partition with comparable quality lies in a sharp basin in the landscape of the parameter space.
